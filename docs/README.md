# Welcome

## Welcome to the Baseline Protocol Community

The Baseline Protocol initiative was [announced](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/) on March 4, 2020 and launched as an [OASIS](https://oasis-open-projects.org/) open source project on March 19, 2020, supported by fourteen founding companies. More companies joined the effort shortly thereafter and continue to do so. In 2021, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and OASIS collaborated to establish the Baseline Protocol and other projects as [EEA Community Projects](https://entethalliance.org/eeacommunityprojects/#:~:text=The%20EEA%20Community%20Projects%2C%20formerly,API%20documentation%20under%20its%20stewardship.). 

The work of the community is maintained under a public domain[ license](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline/blob/master/LICENSE).

The Baseline Protocol is a set of techniques that must be implemented in a standard way across different systems. The draft [open standard](baseline-protocol-standard/core-specification.md) was completed in September, 2021 and submitted to OASIS for review. The current specifications are maintained [here](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-standard).

There are lots of opportunities to get informed, get involved, and **get value** out of developing reusable components, and ultimately deploying the Baseline Protocol in your own offerings. Go to [https://baseline-protocol.org](https://baseline-protocol.org) and click "**Join the Team**".

**New Contributors to the codebase and standard: Go** [**here**](community/open-source-community/contributors.md) **for contribution guidelines.**

## About the Baseline Protocol

The Baseline Protocol is the emerging standard for synchronizing state across different systems of record over the internet, using a public blockchain as a common frame of reference. This applies to traditional corporate systems of record, any kind of database or [state machine](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16447/state-machine), and even different blockchains or DLTs. It is particularly promising as a way to reduce capital expense and other overheads while increasing operational integrity when **automating business processes** across multiple companies.

The approach is designed to appeal to security and performance-minded technology officers.

You can find all the details on the current version of the Baseline Protocol [here](baseline-basics/the-baseline-protocol.md).

## The Baseline Protocol Source Code

Version 1.0 of the Baseline Protocol has been released. It is composed of a set of 6 core packages that are available open-source, under the CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication. For the full license text, refer to [license](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline/blob/master/LICENSE).

You can find more about the source code [here](baseline-protocol-code/packages/).

## The Baseline Protocol Standard

The Baseline Protocol Standard will be a set of three specifications - CORE, API and CCSM that together, provide the requirements to be satisfied to implement a compliant Baseline Protocol Implementation \(BPI\).  

It is developed and will be ratified as an Oasis open standard, available under the CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication. For the full license text, refer to [license](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline/blob/master/LICENSE).

You can find more details on the Baseline Protocol Standard [here](baseline-protocol-standard/overview.md).

## The Baseline Protocol Reference Implementations

A growing number of [Reference Implementations](bri/overview-of-reference-implementations.md) and demos to help you understand _**baselining**_ and give you ideas for your own projects can be found [**here**](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline/tree/master/examples). 

The first complete reference implementation, [**BRI-1**](bri/bri-1/) ****has been developed by individuals and community leaders including Provide, EY, Nethermind, ConsenSys, and others.

Today, there are demos, prototypes, and production systems being developed in more places than can be tracked, and some have been submitted as public domain contributions to the community.

### Baseledger and other Resources

The Baseline Protocol standard does not stipulate the use of any particular state machine as the common frame of reference, where baseline proofs are deposited and managed, in a baselined workgroup. However, the first public Layer-2 implementation of this service is called Baseledger, details about which may be found at [https://baseledger.net](https://baseledger.net).
