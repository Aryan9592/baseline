# Technical Steering Committee

The core of the day-to-day work of the Baseline Protocol community is managed by [members](members.md) and [core developers](maintainers.md). The Technical Steering Committee \(TSC\) is here mainly to ensure the smooth running of the core developer team and to be accountable to the Ethereum-Oasis [Project Governance Board]() \(and to the community at large\).

While it is up to any contributor what one works on, the TSC helps core developers and members by organizing planning and review sessions, roadmapping, and highlighting engineering tasks as high-priority for any given period.

The TSC's members are elected annually in September, with the first elections held in September, 2020, concluding on the last day of that month. The period for nominations will be announced no less than 30 days prior to elections. The method and management of the nominating process and the elections will be communicated to the community by the various [channels](open-source-community.md#communications-connecting-with-each-other-directly) in that timeframe.
